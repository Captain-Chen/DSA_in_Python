# Projects - Data Structures & Algorithms in Python (Goodrich, Tamassia, Goldwasser)

## What is this?
My working solutions for some of the assigned projects in the textbook. Each solution file name follows the format of:  
`p-chapter_number.question_number_descriptor.py` -> `p-2.34_simple_histogram.py`.  
Code may be unoptimized and contain bugs.

## How to run
1. Clone the repository somewhere  
`git clone https://github.com/Captain-Chen/DSA_in_Python.git`
2. Run each solution separately using your debugger and IDE of choice. Solutions typically are outputted to the console.
